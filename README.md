## This project ceoms from the [CodeCademy - Programmign with Python| https://www.codecademy.com/programs/ad021c51a8e534adcb84c9800c88483d] 9 week intensive

### Having worked with Python quite a bit in the past, I jumped around freely in the Intensive, and moved to begin the project prior to completing all the sections.
This project simulates a bookstore/library  in a way. There are Users, and Books (general, fiction, non-fiction).
Inheritance is used as wel as overriding (sich as with __repr__). Also, child Classes only store necessary enew items/arrtibutes.
